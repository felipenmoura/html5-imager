HTML5 Imager

This tool helps you changing the hue and saturation of images, as well as it can be used as a color picker.
You can also pick a color, and remove all the pixels in the image that correspond to that color.

You can see this working at:

This demo uses some interesting HTML5 APIs, such as canvas, imageData, and files.
